There was once a time when people lived with a sense of safety, when children could hide under their covers to escape the boogymen that sauntered through their nightmares. That time, however, is all but forgotten for the last remaining humans. Covers are hardly found anymore, and bullets offer only the illusion of safety. The previous generation with their infinite hubris and insurmountable pride saw fit to attempt to ward off death—a feat no god gave permission to man. And now, in the wasteland of that time, we, the fallen, beaten, and downtrodden, roam the world attempting to find meaning and fruitlessly chasing after normalcy; but how can life regain a tempo when the world digs up any roots you wish to plant? How can you live if the life you have rests on your shoulders and your shoulders alone? In the darkness of night, when otherworldly sounds invade your ears, you attempt to drape serenity over your eyes, but you do knowing that that thin vale won’t stop the nightmares much less the corporeal threats that haunt your physical body; there is no true escape! Just like in the days of old, your kids fire guns, but instead of sticks and twigs, they hold steel; just like the spartans, you teach them how to wrestle and fight, but instead of playing around and having fun, you teach them how fight to the death; you teach them how to play hide and seek, but instead of kicks and giggles, this is a necessary skill to evade capture, torture, and death. That thoughtless generation! That greedy generation! They eventually turned themselves into that which they sought to cure; death, death itself, and they left us to pick up the pieces of a ruined world.
